# CasualServer

A super basic HTTP server implementation in Java. Doesn't have any dependencies.

Not intended for any serious or critical usage. Primarily made for basic home usage, debug server and other shenanigans.

Solves the issue of wanting to setup a basic HTTP server in Java without all the heavy-weight Java EE craziness.
